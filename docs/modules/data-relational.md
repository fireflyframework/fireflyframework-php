# Relational Data

`EloquentRepository` is the Eloquent-backed base every concrete repository extends: it implements the full
[`CrudRepository`/`PagingAndSortingRepository`](data.md#the-ports-crudrepository-pagingandsortingrepository)
contract over `Model::query()`, so an application repository is usually just a `$model` assignment plus its
own derived-query/`#[Query]` methods. This page covers the Eloquent-specific building blocks layered on top:
soft-delete helpers, auditing, and optimistic locking.

## `EloquentRepository`

```php
/** @extends EloquentRepository<Record> */
#[Repository]
class RecordRepository extends EloquentRepository
{
    protected string $model = Record::class;
}
```

Set `protected string $model = X::class;` and the repository inherits `save`/`saveAll`/`findById`/`findAll`/
`findAllById`/`existsById`/`count`/`delete`/`deleteById`/`deleteAll`, plus paging and sorting, all driven from
`($this->model)::query()`. `Page`/`Pageable`/`Sort` are mapped to the Eloquent builder at the edge —
`findPaged()` runs a `count()` query for the total, then `skip($pageable->offset())->take($pageable->size)`
for the slice; `applySort()` folds each `Sort` order into an `->orderBy($property, $direction)` call. Every
list-returning method narrows its raw Eloquent results back to `TModel` via an internal `instanceof
$this->model` check, so callers never see a bare `Model` — only the concrete entity type the repository was
declared over. This class is reflection-free (everything goes through the Eloquent `Builder`, no runtime
class introspection); see [Data & Repositories](data.md) for the derived-query and `#[Query]` dispatch it also
hosts.

## Soft delete

`EloquentRepository` reuses Eloquent's native `SoftDeletes` trait as-is — nothing bespoke:

```php
final class SoftRecord extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
}
```

Once a model `use`s `SoftDeletes`, deleting through the repository (`delete()`/`deleteById()`) soft-deletes
the row, and every ordinary read (`findAll()`, `findById()`, derived queries, …) transparently excludes
trashed rows via Eloquent's own global scope — the repository adds no extra filtering of its own. Two helpers
round out the lifecycle:

```php
public function findAllIncludingDeleted(): array;   // removes the SoftDeletingScope for this one call
public function restore(mixed $id): ?object;         // nulls deleted_at, then re-reads (now visible again)
```

`findAllIncludingDeleted()` drops `SoftDeletingScope` for that query only (later calls still exclude trashed
rows as normal); `restore()` writes `deleted_at = null` for the given id and returns the freshly re-read
entity, or `null` if no such row exists. Both are meaningful only on a model that actually uses `SoftDeletes`
— on a plain model the scope is simply absent, so calling them is a harmless no-op.

## Auditing

`Auditable` is an opt-in trait for `created_by`/`updated_by` stamping:

```php
final class AuditedRecord extends Model
{
    use Auditable;
}
```

`use Auditable` registers an `AuditObserver` (deferred to Eloquent's `whenBooted()` hook, since
`Model::observe()` can't run while the model is still mid-boot) that stamps `created_by` and `updated_by` on
insert, and `updated_by` again on every update. Stamping is driven by an `AuditorAware` port:

```php
interface AuditorAware
{
    public function currentAuditor(): int|string|null;
}
```

!!! note "Known-latent: auditing is a no-op before M11"
    `AuditObserver` resolves `AuditorAware` from the container at write time; while nothing is bound (which is
    the case until M11's security-context principal lands), it simply returns early and leaves `created_by`/
    `updated_by` untouched. Binding an `AuditorAware` implementation is what turns stamping on — no code change
    to `Auditable`-using models is needed once that lands.

## Optimistic locking

`HasOptimisticLock` guards concurrent writes to the same row with a `version` integer column:

```php
final class VersionedRecord extends Model
{
    use HasOptimisticLock;

    protected $attributes = ['version' => 0];
}
```

The trait overrides Eloquent's internal `performUpdate()`: every update bumps `version` by one and adds
`WHERE version = <the version the row was loaded with>` to the `UPDATE`. If that `WHERE` matches zero rows —
because someone else's write already moved the version — the row changed underneath the caller, and
`OptimisticLockException` is thrown instead of silently applying (or silently losing) the write:

```php
$a = $repo->findById($id);
$b = $repo->findById($id);   // same row, same starting version

$a->name = 'first';
$repo->save($a);             // succeeds; version bumps 0 -> 1

$b->name = 'second';
$repo->save($b);             // throws OptimisticLockException: version moved to 1 underneath $b
```

Insert is untouched — a new row simply starts at its default `version`; only updates are guarded. The column
name defaults to `version` (`optimisticLockColumn()`, overridable per model).

## The domain-event bridge

`EloquentRepository::save()` does two things when it persists an entity: it calls `$entity->save()` if the
entity is an Eloquent `Model`, and — separately — if the entity also implements `RecordsDomainEvents` (either
by extending `AggregateRoot` or, for a `Model`, by `use HasDomainEvents`) **and** a transaction is currently
active on that entity's own connection, it registers the entity with the `AggregateTracker` unit-of-work
registry. That registration is what lets the framework drain and publish the entity's raised events after the
surrounding transaction commits — see [Domain (DDD)](domain.md#the-after-commit-event-model) for the event
model itself and [Transactions](transactional.md) for the commit/rollback machinery that drives the drain.
