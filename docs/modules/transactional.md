# Transactions

`firefly/data`'s `#[Transactional]` is LaraFly's declarative transaction-demarcation model (a Spring
`@Transactional` analog) over Laravel's own connection: a proxy generated at scan time wraps every annotated
method in a `TransactionInterceptor` that drives transaction boundaries through **manual**
`DB::beginTransaction()`/`commit()`/`rollBack()` — never `DB::transaction($closure)` — because only manual
control lets a caught exception be committed-and-rethrown (when it matches `noRollbackFor`, or matches neither
list) instead of unconditionally rolled back.

## The `#[Transactional]` attribute

```php
#[Attribute(Attribute::TARGET_CLASS | Attribute::TARGET_METHOD)]
final class Transactional
{
    public function __construct(
        public Propagation $propagation = Propagation::REQUIRED,
        public Isolation $isolation = Isolation::DEFAULT,
        public bool $readOnly = false,
        public array $rollbackFor = [Throwable::class],
        public array $noRollbackFor = [],
        public ?string $connection = null,
        public ?int $timeout = null,
    ) {}
}
```

On a **class**, it sets the default for every public method. On a **method**, it *replaces* — does not merge
with — the class-level attribute for that one method (Spring semantics): a method-level `#[Transactional]`
is the complete, effective configuration for that method, not an override of individual fields.

```php
#[Transactional(readOnly: true)]        // class default: every public method is read-only REQUIRED
class TransferService
{
    #[Transactional(propagation: Propagation::REQUIRES_NEW)]   // replaces the class default entirely for transfer()
    public function transfer(int $amount): int { /* ... */ }

    public function balance(): int { /* ... */ }   // inherits the class-level readOnly default
}
```

Default `rollbackFor = [Throwable::class]`: PHP has no checked/unchecked exception split, so by default *any*
throwable rolls back the transaction, unless it also matches `noRollbackFor` (which always wins).

`timeout` is in seconds and is enforced — see [Timeouts](#timeouts).

## The seven propagation modes

`Propagation` is an unbacked enum with all seven Spring modes, including `NESTED` (which Laravel's automatic
savepoints make possible over a plain relational connection):

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `REQUIRED` *(default)* | Joins the caller's transaction if one is active; otherwise starts a new outermost one. |
| `REQUIRES_NEW` | Always starts a transaction. If none is active it becomes the new outermost transaction; if one is **already active on the same connection**, Laravel has no suspend primitive, so it degrades to a nested `beginTransaction()` — i.e. a savepoint, not a truly independent transaction (see [Known-latent](#known-latent)). |
| `NESTED` | Same underlying mechanics as `REQUIRES_NEW` in this implementation: a fresh outermost transaction if none is active, otherwise a nested `beginTransaction()` that Laravel turns into a savepoint — so a `NESTED` failure unwinds only to its own savepoint, not the whole unit of work. |
| `SUPPORTS` | Runs in the caller's transaction if one is active; otherwise runs with no transaction at all. Never starts one. |
| `NOT_SUPPORTED` | Always runs with no transaction. On the same connection there is no suspend primitive, so an already-active transaction is simply **not** paused — the work still runs inside it (see [Known-latent](#known-latent)). |
| `MANDATORY` | Requires an active transaction; runs in it if present, otherwise throws `TransactionRequiredException`. |
| `NEVER` | Forbids an active transaction; throws `TransactionNotAllowedException` if one is active, otherwise runs with none. |

`TransactionTemplate::execute()` is the single source of truth both the generated proxy and any programmatic
caller go through — there is no second code path to keep in sync.

## Isolation, read-only, and rollback rules

`Isolation` is a string-backed enum whose value **is** the SQL clause:

```php
enum Isolation: string
{
    case DEFAULT = 'DEFAULT';                  // no SET at all — leaves the connection's own default
    case READ_UNCOMMITTED = 'READ UNCOMMITTED';
    case READ_COMMITTED = 'READ COMMITTED';
    case REPEATABLE_READ = 'REPEATABLE READ';
    case SERIALIZABLE = 'SERIALIZABLE';
}
```

On the outermost transaction of a unit of work, a non-`DEFAULT` isolation issues `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION
LEVEL {value}`; `readOnly: true` issues `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY`. Both are **best-effort**: either
statement failing (a driver that doesn't support it) is caught and silently ignored rather than failing the
whole transaction — see [Known-latent](#known-latent).

`rollbackFor`/`noRollbackFor` are evaluated in that order when the wrapped work throws:

1. If the thrown exception is an instance of anything in `noRollbackFor`, the transaction **commits** and the
   exception is rethrown (`noRollbackFor` always wins, even over a matching `rollbackFor`).
2. Otherwise, if it matches `rollbackFor` (default `[Throwable::class]`, i.e. everything), the transaction
   **rolls back** and the exception is rethrown.
3. Otherwise (matches neither list — only reachable with a narrowed `rollbackFor`), the transaction
   **commits** and the exception is rethrown.

If that commit-and-rethrow's commit itself fails (a deferred constraint reported at `COMMIT`, a connection
lost on the way), the transaction is rolled back instead and a `TransactionSystemException`
(`TRANSACTION_SYSTEM_ERROR`, 500) escapes carrying both failures — Spring's shape: the commit failure is its
`previous`, the method's own exception its `$applicationException`. A commit that fails after the method
*returned* is rolled back the same way and the failure is rethrown on its own.

```php
#[Transactional(noRollbackFor: [IgnorableException::class])]
public function logButKeep(): void
{
    DB::table('accounts')->insert(['name' => 'kept']);

    throw new IgnorableException('ignored');   // insert survives: commit-and-rethrow
}
```

Either way — commit or roll back — after-commit domain events queued during the unit of work are drained via
`DomainEventDispatcher::dispatchAfterCommit()` *before* the transaction is resolved, on the descriptor's own
`connection`, so a `#[Transactional(connection: 'x')]` method fires its listeners on `x`'s commit; Laravel
discards `afterCommit` callbacks on rollback, so a listener never sees an event from a rolled-back unit of
work. See [Domain (DDD)](domain.md#the-after-commit-event-model).

## Timeouts

`#[Transactional(timeout: 5)]` (seconds) is enforced on the **outermost** transaction the template starts.
Right after `beginTransaction()` the driver is told to give up on a statement past the budget — pgsql
`SET LOCAL statement_timeout` (transaction-scoped, nothing to restore), mysql `SET SESSION
max_execution_time` (milliseconds, `SELECT`s only) or mariadb `SET SESSION max_statement_time` (seconds, any
statement — mariadb has no `max_execution_time` variable, and a `mysql` connection whose server is mariadb is
detected through the server version), each with `innodb_lock_wait_timeout`, every previous value read first
and restored in a `finally` independently of the other, sqlite `PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT` (the busy timeout — the
only knob sqlite has) restored to the configured `busy_timeout` — and a wall-clock deadline is taken. When the
method **returns** past that deadline the transaction is rolled back and `TransactionTimedOutException` (504
`TRANSACTION_TIMED_OUT`) is thrown; a method whose own exception ended it keeps that exception. A joined
`REQUIRED` and a `NESTED` savepoint run under the outer budget — Spring semantics.
`firefly.data.transaction.default-timeout` applies when the attribute names none (0 = no deadline);
`firefly.data.transaction.statement-timeout=false` keeps only the wall-clock check.

## Transactional event listeners

`#[TransactionalEventListener]` is the transaction-aware alternative to `#[AsEventListener]` — Spring's
`@TransactionalEventListener`:

```php
#[Component]
final class OrderAudit
{
    #[TransactionalEventListener]                                              // AFTER_COMMIT
    public function record(OrderPlaced $event): void { /* the row is committed */ }

    #[TransactionalEventListener(phase: TransactionPhase::BEFORE_COMMIT)]
    public function check(OrderPlaced $event): void { /* inside the transaction; a throw aborts the commit */ }

    #[TransactionalEventListener(phase: TransactionPhase::AFTER_ROLLBACK, fallbackExecution: true)]
    public function undo(OrderPlaced $event): void { /* also runs at once when no transaction is active */ }
}
```

The event is published immediately (a plain `#[AsEventListener]` on the same event still runs inside the
transaction); **this** listener is queued on the current transaction and runs in its phase — `BEFORE_COMMIT`
inside the commit (Laravel's `TransactionCommitting`, before the PDO commit, so a throw rolls back),
`AFTER_COMMIT` after the root commit (`Connection::afterCommit()`, discarded on rollback), `AFTER_ROLLBACK`
after a rollback (`Connection::afterRollBack()`), `AFTER_COMPLETION` after either. A listener queued inside a
savepoint (`NESTED`, or `REQUIRES_NEW` joined on the same connection) belongs to that savepoint: when it rolls
back and the outer transaction goes on to commit, the event's listeners see `AFTER_ROLLBACK` (and
`AFTER_COMPLETION`) and nothing else. With no active transaction the listener is skipped unless
`fallbackExecution: true`. The event class is inferred from the first parameter (or named with `event:`);
`order` sorts transactional listeners among themselves. They are compiled by the same scanner into the
manifest's `listeners` map and registered by `DataWiringProvider`'s `TransactionalEventListenerWiringPass` at
`BootPhase::EventListeners`; `TransactionSynchronizationRegistry` is the bean that queues them, and
`TransactionTemplate` tells it which connection is current so a `#[Transactional(connection: 'x')]` method's
listeners bind to `x` (an event published inside a plain `DB::transaction()` binds to the default connection).

Relationship with the domain-event bridge: `DomainEventDispatcher::publishAfterCommit()` defers the **event**
— nobody hears it before commit; `#[TransactionalEventListener]` defers the **listener** — the event is heard
now, this method later. Use the bridge for aggregates' domain events, the attribute for a listener that must
see committed state (or a rollback) for any application event.

## Exception translation

`TransactionTemplate::execute()` translates whatever escapes any propagation arm into the kernel's
`DataAccessException` family (see [Data & Repositories](data.md#exception-translation)), so a
`#[Transactional]` method throws `DuplicateKeyException`, `BadSqlGrammarException`, … whether or not the
failing statement went through a repository. `rollbackFor`/`noRollbackFor` are matched against the translated
exception **and** the original underneath it, so a `noRollbackFor: [QueryException::class]` written before
translation existed still matches. A commit that itself fails is rolled back before the failure is rethrown.

## The proxy model

A `#[Transactional]` bean is not called directly — `TransactionalBeanPostProcessor` (a `#[Component]`
discovered by its `BeanPostProcessor` interface and installed by `RegisterBeanPostProcessorsPass` at **phase
700**) swaps it, on the second BPP pass (after `#[PostConstruct]` has already run on the real bean), for an
instance of a generated `final class {Target}__FireflyTransactionalProxy extends {Target}`. Since the interceptor
chain landed, the same proxy carries **every advice** a class runs, not only transactions: each override builds a
`MethodInvocation` over the ORDERED interceptors compiled for that method and the descriptors baked for it, and
`proceed()` walks the chain outermost-first before reaching `parent::`:

```php
public function transfer(int $amount): int
{
    return (new \Firefly\Data\Proxy\MethodInvocation(
        $this,
        \App\AccountService::class,
        'transfer',
        [$amount],
        [$this->__fireflySecurityInterceptor, $this->__fireflyTxInterceptor],
        [
            \Firefly\Security\Access\Method\SecurityMethodDescriptor::class => self::__fireflySecurityDescriptor('transfer'),
            \Firefly\Data\Transaction\TransactionalDescriptor::class => self::__fireflyTxDescriptor('transfer'),
        ],
        fn (array $__fireflyArgs) => parent::transfer(...$__fireflyArgs),
    ))->proceed();
}
```

The pieces, all in `Firefly\Data\Proxy`:

- `MethodInterceptor` — the AOP Alliance port: `invoke(MethodInvocation): mixed`. `TransactionInterceptor`
  implements it (its `invoke()` reads the `TransactionalDescriptor` off the invocation and calls the unchanged
  `run()`, which delegates to `TransactionTemplate::execute()`); firefly/security's `MethodSecurityInterceptor` is
  the other shipped link.
- `MethodInvocation` — single-use: `proceed()`, `getArguments()`/`setArguments()` (a `#[PreFilter]` narrows what
  the method receives), `descriptor(class)` (each link reads its own baked descriptor), `getThis()`,
  `getDeclaredClass()`, `getMethod()`.
- `Advice` — a KIND of advice: id (`tx`, `security`), interceptor bean class, descriptor class, and **order** —
  lower runs outer. The transactional advice is 1000 and security's is 100, so a refusal never opens a transaction.
  An advice whose interceptor is switched off by design (security's, under the master flag) says so with
  `inertWhenUnbound`; every other advice whose interceptor has vanished fails loud at wrap time.
- `AdviceSource` — the port a package implements to contribute: `scan()` (its own sanctioned scanner, at cache time),
  `render()` (the PHP literal baked into the proxy) and `advice()`. `TransactionalAdviceSource` is Data's;
  `MethodSecurityAdviceSource` is Security's. Both are `#[Component]`s, so the uncached boot collects them through
  `Container::getAll()`.
- `ProxyPlan` — the merged manifest (`proxy-plan.php`, written by `firefly:cache`): per class, the proxy class, the
  advice kinds and, per method, the ordered `(advice, descriptor row)` pairs. `ProxyPlanner` builds it from the
  sources and renders the generator's inputs; `InterceptorRegistry` resolves each advice's interceptor bean at wrap
  time, degrading to a `PassThroughInterceptor` when that capability is switched off.

The plan is resolved like every manifest: the compiled `proxy-plan.php`; else — a cache from before that file
existed, holding `transactional.php` and its proxies but no plan — a transactional-only plan bridged from the
`TransactionalManifest` that loaded it (a cached app trusts its artifacts and never falls back to the scan; an
advice such a plan knows nothing about is a reason to recompile, which is why firefly/security refuses to boot over
its compiled rules beside a plan-less cache); else an in-process scan of `firefly.scan.paths` through every
`AdviceSource`; else — no scan paths but a bound `TransactionalManifest` — a transactional-only plan derived from
it. `ProxyFactory` instantiates the proxy **state-preservingly**: `newInstanceWithoutConstructor()` (so
`#[PostConstruct]` is not re-run), then the real bean's initialised state is copied slot by slot, each slot
written by a closure bound to the class that *declares* it — never `ReflectionProperty::setValue()` — and a
last bound closure sets one private interceptor property per advice the generated `__fireflyAdvice()` table
names. Writing from the declaring class is what lets the copy reach a `private` on a parent
(`EloquentRepository`'s translator under every `#[Repository]`) and initialise a parent's `protected readonly`
(`EloquentRepository`'s manifest and tracker) on PHP 8.3, where a readonly property is initialisable from its
declaring class's scope alone; two privates under one name in a parent and a child stay two slots. The proxy
*is-a* `{Target}`, so container calls and `#[PreDestroy]` resolve against it exactly as they would the
original bean. A `final` target
is refused at scan time (`UnsupportedTransactionalMethodException::finalClass()`), where the manifest row is
still in view, and so is a `final` planned METHOD
(`UnsupportedTransactionalMethodException::finalMethod()`) — the proxy overrides every method it plans, so
without that refusal PHP rejects the generated class at load with "Cannot override final method", a fatal that
names neither the attribute nor the class-level one that fanned onto the method. That refusal reports the
class that DECLARES the method: a class-level `#[Transactional]` plans every public method the class exposes,
inherited ones included, so the `final` is often in a base the reader does not own (the framework's own
`AutoConfiguration::register()` is one) and the message reads `Base::register() (planned via Leaf)`. It is a
refusal rather than a skip — observability's metric scan skips the same shape — because a `#[Transactional]`
method running with no transaction around it leaves half the writes committed on a mid-method failure, where a
dropped meter only loses a line on a dashboard. Narrow the attribute onto the methods that need it, or run the
work through `TransactionTemplate`.

**Self-invocation bypasses the proxy** — the same well-known Spring limitation. A method calling
`$this->otherMethod()` from inside the proxied class calls straight through `parent::`, skipping the
interceptor entirely. To get transactional semantics for an inner unit of work from within another method,
call through the injected `TransactionTemplate` instead:

```php
#[Service]
#[Transactional]
class AccountService
{
    public function __construct(private readonly TransactionTemplate $template) {}

    public function outerWithNested(): void
    {
        DB::table('accounts')->insert(['name' => 'outer']);

        try {
            $this->template->execute(function (): void {
                DB::table('accounts')->insert(['name' => 'inner']);
                throw new RuntimeException('inner fail');
            }, new TransactionalDescriptor(propagation: Propagation::NESTED));
        } catch (RuntimeException) {
            // outer commit is unaffected — only the NESTED savepoint unwound
        }
    }
}
```

`TransactionTemplate::execute()` is the programmatic twin of `#[Transactional]` for exactly this case (or for
any transactional unit of work that isn't a whole bean method):

```php
$template->execute(function (): void {
    DB::table('widgets')->insert(['name' => 'a']);
    DB::table('widgets')->insert(['name' => 'b']);
});                                        // no descriptor -> REQUIRED / default isolation / rollback-on-Throwable

$template->execute($work, new TransactionalDescriptor(
    propagation: Propagation::REQUIRES_NEW,
    noRollbackFor: [IgnorableException::class],
));
```

## Known-latent

- **The manifest and its proxies must stay one matched unit — and they now are, on both boot paths.**
  `DataAutoConfiguration::transactionalManifest()` resolves the compiled `transactional.php` if
  `firefly:cache` wrote one (registering the `proxies.php` classmap autoloader first, so `firefly/cli` is not
  required at runtime), otherwise the `ProxyPlan` bean scans `firefly.scan.paths` through every
  `AdviceSource` and materialises each planned proxy per process through `ProxyMaterializer` — a private `0700` directory
  written with `O_EXCL`, dev-time cost only. Proxies are made loadable **before** the manifest is handed out,
  because `TransactionalBeanPostProcessor` throws a `ConfigurationException` when the manifest promises a
  proxy class it cannot find; a half-emitted cache therefore fails at boot rather than quietly running
  unproxied. Until this landed, the auto-config bound an unconditional empty manifest and *nothing* loaded
  the compiled `transactional.php`, so `#[Transactional]` was a **silent no-op** in any application that did
  not hand-write its own manifest configuration — which is precisely what the skeleton's
  `app/Support/CachedTransactionalConfiguration.php` existed to do, and why it has been deleted.
- **`REQUIRES_NEW`/`NOT_SUPPORTED` cannot truly suspend an active transaction on the same connection** —
  Laravel has no suspend primitive. `REQUIRES_NEW` is genuinely independent only when it targets a distinct
  configured `connection` from the caller's; on the *same* connection it degrades to a nested savepoint
  instead. `NOT_SUPPORTED` on the same connection cannot pause the ambient transaction either — the work still
  runs inside it rather than truly outside a transaction.
- **Isolation and read-only are driver-dependent.** The `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`/`SET TRANSACTION
  READ ONLY` statements are issued best-effort and swallowed on failure — SQLite, for instance, ignores or
  limits both. The driver-level statement timeout is best-effort in the same way: sqlite has only a busy
  timeout (a merely slow statement is not interruptible, and the wall-clock check catches it on return), and
  mysql's `max_execution_time` applies to `SELECT`s only (mariadb's `max_statement_time` interrupts any
  statement).
- **`#[TransactionalEventListener]` needs the connection's event dispatcher for `BEFORE_COMMIT`** (every
  Laravel-configured connection has one; a hand-built `Connection` without `setEventDispatcher()` gets a
  `ConfigurationException` at the first `BEFORE_COMMIT` registration). `order` sorts transactional
  listeners among themselves, not against `#[AsEventListener]`s of the same event, which always run first. The
  scanner reads concrete classes in `firefly.scan.paths`; a listener on a class produced only by a
  `#[Bean]` factory is not discovered.
- **Auditing's `created_by`/`updated_by` no-op until the M11 security-context principal is bound** — see
  [Relational Data](data-relational.md#auditing) for the full behaviour and how it turns on.
- **Auto after-commit dispatch covers aggregates saved through a Firefly repository** (`EloquentRepository::
  save()` registering with `AggregateTracker`) within the transaction. For a recorder not saved that way, use
  the explicit `DomainEventDispatcher::publishAfterCommit($aggregate, $connection)` escape hatch to get the
  same after-commit-only publish guarantee.
